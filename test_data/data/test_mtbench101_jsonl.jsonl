If Box 2 is full, then Box 1 is empty. I checked Box 1 and it was full. What can you infer about Box 2?", "bot": "Since Box 1 is full, based on the given conditions, this means Box 2 must be empty. The conditions state that if one box is full, the other must be empty."}, {"user": "I forgot to mention, there's a third box. Box 3 is full only if Box 2 is empty. Now, is Box 3 full or empty?", "bot": "From the previous information, we know Box 2 is empty because Box 1 is full.
